### Overview

Farmer's Delight is a mod focused on providing solid cooking mechanics and extending the different forms of farming in the game. The goal is to add only a gentle amount of new content to farm and collect, instead focusing on giving more purpose to existing items and blocks that would otherwise pass under the player's radar.

This mod is currently **under development**, so issues and instabilities may occur. If you'd like to play, keep in mind:
- Backup your saves often;
- Make sure everything is working well before adding it to a modpack;
- Report any issues you find to our issue tracker!

### Contributing

Thank you for visiting the repository! If you'd like to contribute with the mod, feel free to check the issues page!

Since I'm a relative beginner with Minecraft modding, I'm sure many of my implementations might be inefficient or suboptimal. That said, I am open to constructive feedback: if you spot any glaring mistakes in my code, and/or you know a better way to accomplish something, feel free to open an issue/PR about it. Thank you for your help! =)
